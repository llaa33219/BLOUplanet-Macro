# Required Installation Commands

Below are the commands you need to run to install the required packages:

1. **pynput**  
   This is the only external package that needs to be installed via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```
2. **tkinter** (Built-in Python library)  
   Python includes tkinter by default, but some Linux distributions might require separate installation.  
   For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```
